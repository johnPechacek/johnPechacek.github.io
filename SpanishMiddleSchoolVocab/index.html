        <p>I led collaborative design sessions with the entire team. I designed and developed the UI for each of the 5 activities and menus across 3 stylistic themes.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <h5>Cover the gap in Istation's middle school Spanish educational standards coverage in just 3 months.</h5>
        <p>This project came about during a tumultuous time for the Istation Spanish team. We had just lost several key team members and there was an unexpected change in leadership. We had just released brand new learning content for middle school Spanish, a product called "The World of Genres" where students explore the worlds of the past, the present, and the future.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we had not been able to cover vocabulary content needed to hit Istation's educational standards quota, so there was a content gap that needed to be filled immediately. The new vocabulary content needed to fit visually and thematically with the existing past, present, and future worlds of the World of Genres. We had a very tight 3 month deadline to take the project from conception to full release.</p>

        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <h5>A series of low stakes vocabulary activities, gamified with a simple reward system.</h5>
        <p>With such a tight deadline, I knew the design phase needed to be short and effective. I convinced the team to adopt a template approach, so that we were only finding a single solution to the problem instead of a separate solution for each of the three worlds in World of Genres. From that starting point, the team collectively ideated on what the template should be. We settled on the idea of teaching and drilling students with 5 short activities. Each activity would approach the same group of words from different angles, helping them stick better in the students' minds.</p>
        <p>We had one artist on the team, and unique illustrations were needed for each of the 150+ vocabulary words, so reusing as much UI as possible was very important. For 4 of the 5 activities, I designed and developed reusable cards UI inspired by playing cards. This UI gave me an idea for a simple reward system.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/solitaireRef.png"></div>
        <p>I loved the solitaire game that came with Windows 95 growing up. It had an interesting feature where the user could customize the art on the back of the cards used in the game. Inspired by that concept, I created a pool of card back patterns and decals made to match the corresponding past, present, and future worlds in World of Genres.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/WK_rewards.gif"></div>
        <p>When the student completed any of the 5 activities they were presented with a new card back design from randomizing the patterns and decals available from the world they were currently in. They could then select from their growing collection of card back designs at any time.</p>
